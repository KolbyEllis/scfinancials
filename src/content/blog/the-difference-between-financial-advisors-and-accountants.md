Accountants can be a more specialized area of tax, while financial advisors will typically have a broader knowledge base. 

Accountants lean toward compliance and reporting, while financial advisors are focused on financial planning and wealth management. Accountants have one option for education, achieving a CPA (Certified Public Accountant). While financial advisors may have a variety of educational backgrounds and may hold many different professional designations. But the most popular and widely known designation is a CFP ® (Certified Financial Planner ™).

Financial advisors and accountants require a high level of knowledge and expertise in financial matters. 

Both jobs require problem-solving and analytical skills. 

Those that hold CPA and CFP ®certifications are required to uphold professional standards like confidentiality and be a [fiduciary](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-fiduciary-en-1769/), requiring them to act in their client’s best interest. 

#### How can you decide whether you need an accountant or a financial advisor?

Most people use both but use the following questions to determine whether you need a financial advisor or an accountant:

What financial tasks do you need help with? An accountant may be a better option if you require assistance with tasks like completing and submitting your tax returns or evaluating financial records. A financial advisor may be more appropriate if you require assistance with developing a long-term financial strategy, investing your money, or managing risk. How much time and energy are you willing to devote to managing your money? Financial advisors offer advice and support to help you make well-informed decisions, while accountants can save you time and effort by doing financial responsibility for you.

If you possess the knowledge, confidence, and desire required to DIY your finances, you may not require the assistance of an accountant or financial advisor if you are confident in your capacity to manage your finances. Even if you feel confident, typically you will run into a situation where you won’t so it helps to know a CPA or financial advisor that you trust. Both accountants and CPAs typically offer a free consultation to talk through and find out if they can help. If you want to talk to one of our financial advisors, [contact us](/contact).
