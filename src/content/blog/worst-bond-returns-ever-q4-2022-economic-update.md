The calendar year 2022 was one for the record books for the financial markets. The US bond market as measured by the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index had the worst returns in its history, while US stocks as measured by the S&P 500 index suffered the third worst returns since 1976, surpassed only in 2002 and 2008. Whether it was small cap, large cap, real estate, international or domestic, most asset classes suffered negative returns in 2022, with one bright spot being [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity-market.asp), which was reflecting the inflationary pressures that were impacting the globe. The surge in global inflation, rooted primarily in excessive growth in the money supply and exacerbated by continued supply chain restrictions, forced the US Fed and other central banks to vigorously raise interest rates in 2022, with the US Fed Funds rate raising from 0.08% to 4.33%. This dramatic rise in interest rates in 2022 was the chief (but not sole) cause of the repricing in both stocks and bonds, and hence the negative returns for the year.   Representative domestic and global index returns (total returns including the reinvestment of interest and dividends) for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the 2022 calendar year are shown in the following table-  *(these represent index returns (2)for several asset classes and not for your portfolio, and are for informational purposes only)*:

**Bright spot**

The bright spot for 2022 was indeed the fourth quarter which saw returns across many asset classes climb from their lows, as reflected in the above chart. Buyers started returning to the investment markets in hope that most of the interest rate increases by the Fed to combat inflation are in the rearview mirror, and that the Fed will “pivot” in 2023 with a change in policy from tightening to easing. Further inversion of the yield curve allowed for some positive returns in bonds as intermediate and longer-term yields declined.  However, we are not out of the woods yet, and investor optimism, which is spreading into the first quarter of 2023, may be a bit premature. Fed policies of higher rates and reductions in the money supply (M2) appear to be getting the desired result of reducing inflation, with the inflation rate dropping from its high of 9.1% in June to 6.5% in December (CPI – non-seasonally adjusted). The Fed is clear that its inflation target is 2.0%, so there is still significant work to be done. It has also made it clear that it will do whatever is necessary to get to the 2.0% inflation target. At the annual Fed meeting in Jackson Hole this past August, Fed chairman Powell stated:

**The Fed**

It is this “sustained period of below trend growth” and “pain to households and businesses” that the current markets may not be significantly discounting in current asset prices.  The Fed has not made it clear where short-term interest rates will peak, although Fed officials have recently projected rates peaking in 2023 in the 5.25% to 5.50% range. As for when the Fed will begin to lower rates, Chairman Powell has indicated that no cuts would be considered by the committee until inflation was shown to be moving toward the 2.0% target in a sustained manner.  As history shows, the Fed’s past cycles of raising rates have consistently pushed the US economy into recession. Powell has eluded in so many words to the possibility of a coming recession because of the current restrictive policies, which the Fed feels are necessary to suppress demand. The growing consensus amongst economists is that we will indeed see a recession in 2023 or early 2024, but there are disagreements as to how deep and how long the upcoming recession will be. Certain economic and market indicators are flashing recession warnings, but the labor market has not weakened materially as would be expected leading into a recession, and this is leading some to believe that either we can avoid a recession (the Fed’s “soft landing”), or the recession will be mild. However, will this be the last shoe to drop? Time will tell.  

**Impossible to forecast**

Overall, these are “unprecedented times” as Brian Wesbury, the well-known and respected chief economist at First Trust Advisors has stated repeatedly over the past 24 months. Since the Great Recession in 2008-09, Brian has been spot-on in his economic and related market forecasts, and that has earned him the right for his opinions to be thoroughly considered. At a conference I attended last week, Mr. Wesbury, whose career spans the past 40 years, stated “I have never seen a more difficult time to forecast.” Considering this comment, Mr. Wesbury is forecasting a recession in 2023. Although labeled a “Perma-Bull” for years for his optimistic forecasts for the equity markets, Mr. Wesbury is now bearish overall on US stocks in 2023, with a key reason being that investors have not yet taken into consideration the decline in corporate profits that he expects for 2023 due to the slowing US and global economies.  

**Sooner rather than later**

The Bespoke Investment Group, a purveyor of timely economic and investment market data to which we subscribe, has consistently been optimistic in its outlook over the past decade. However, in their 2023 Outlook published in December 2022, Bespoke has turned a bit dour with a recession forecast, a view they support through current data and from past economic cycles. They state:

**The "R" word**

Dr. Gary Shilling, the well-respected economist, is predicting a [recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp), as are most major US banks, including JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, and the list could go on.  So, the “R” word is out on the streets and is no surprise. The real question is whether this recession reality has been fully factored into corporate earnings and subsequently into stock valuations.

**There is good news**

The bad news is that 2022 was a nasty year in terms of investment returns and there will be a recession soon. But there is good news. Bond yields have risen to levels that are accretive to portfolio returns without sacrificing credit quality, something that we have not seen for more than a decade. The bond markets are being set up for significant returns when the Fed eventually will lower interest rates (the yield curve is suggesting that this could be sooner than later). Stock valuations have fallen to levels that are setting up portfolios for substantially better long-term returns. There is value returning to certain markets, particularly international and [emerging market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp) stocks. It is good to remember that whenever there is bad news, there is typically always opportunity. This year will be one of continued volatility in investment markets, and stock lows may again be tested, but overall things are being set up for better returns ahead.
