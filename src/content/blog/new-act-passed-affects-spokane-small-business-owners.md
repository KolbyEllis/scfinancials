As a financial advising practice whose niche is Spokane small business owners, we have many clients affected by this law. Because we can work with many business owners, we can notify them of current financial news and information that applies to their business and personal financial plans. Recently there was a new Act passed- the Corporate Transparency Act. This Act requires small businesses to file a report. 



#### Our article aims to concisely give you all the information you need.



#### Quick overview

* **Applies** to corporations and LLCs. (Trusts, general partnerships, sole proprietorships, and companies with more than 20 or more full time employees are excluded. But if your sole prop is an LLC, you must file a report.

#### Purpose behind law

* Enhance national security, intelligence, and law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities.
* Bring the U.S. into compliance with international anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing standards.
* It's been addressed that this is not to create a public registry of business entities in the U.S.



#### More information

* **For entities in existence before January 1st, 2024, each entity must disclose information about the entity itself and its beneficial owners before January 1st, 2025.** 
* An individual who willfully provides false or fraudulent information or willfully fails to report complete and updated beneficial ownership information can face a civil penalty of $500/day if the violation continues or is not remedied and a criminal fine of up to $10,000 and/or two years imprisonment. There is a 90-day safe harbor if an individual voluntarily submits a report containing correct information.
* Each entity must include its legal name and all associated trade names. They must also disclose the EIN and physical street address of the business.
* Each beneficial owner(any owner that directly or indirectly owns or controls at least 25% of the business interests) must include their full legal name, date of birth, current address, and identification (driver's license or passport) with a picture.
