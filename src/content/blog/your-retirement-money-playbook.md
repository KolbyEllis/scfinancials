As you approach retirement, ensuring your financial security becomes even more important. The decisions you make now can profoundly impact your quality of life during your golden years. To help you navigate this crucial phase, a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERâ„¢ compiled a list of the most common strategies successful retirees use to achieve their goals. This list of strategic money moves from a Spokane financial advisor is designed to optimize your retirement savings and safeguard your economic well-being. Let's dive into these essential steps leading to a secure retirement.

#### Prioritize Retirement Savings Over Lifestyle Inflation

Increasing your spending as your income rises is tempting, especially when you see those around you doing the same. However, a critical money move is to resist the urge to let lifestyle inflation creep in. Instead, heed this advice and channel your pay increases into retirement savings. By maintaining a steady standard of living while ramping up your retirement contributions, you'll build a more substantial nest egg for the future. It's important to realize that it's okay to set aside a portion of that pay increase for a reward. Just make sure that you increase your savings as well. The more your lifestyle creeps, the more you will have to save in retirement to cover a more expensive lifestyle.

#### Embrace the Power of Early Savings

Time is one of the most potent weapons in your retirement arsenal. Starting to save for retirement early allows you to harness the magic of compounding growth. The earlier you begin, the more time your investments have to grow exponentially. Even small contributions can snowball into a significant sum over the years, putting you ahead on your retirement timeline. You still need to if you feel like you've waited too long. The best time to invest is today.

#### Hands Off Retirement Funds

Preserve your retirement funds. While it might be tempting to dip into your retirement funds for immediate needs, this decision can have far-reaching consequences. Every withdrawal not only reduces your current retirement savings but also hampers the growth potential of those funds. This is one of the biggest disasters to someone's retirement. Avoid the temptation to tap into your retirement accounts, as doing so could add years, or even decades, to your target retirement date.

#### Craft an Airtight Estate Plan

Estate planning isn't just for the wealthy; it's a crucial step for everyone, especially as retirement looms closer. Your Spokane financial advisor recommends updating beneficiary information on your financial accounts to ensure a smooth transition of assets. Consulting an attorney can ensure that your estate plan aligns with your wishes and that your financial affairs are all in order.

#### Harness Professional Financial Advice

Navigating the complex landscape of retirement planning requires expertise. Enlist the help of your Spokane financial advisor to maximize your investments, take advantage of tax-saving strategies, and identify any gaps in your financial plan. A qualified advisor can provide the guidance needed to fine-tune your retirement strategy and ensure you're on the right track.

#### Balancing Present Enjoyment and Future Security

Retirement planning isn't solely about sacrificing your present enjoyment for future security. It's essential to strike a balance between spending and saving. While it's wise to be financially prudent, remember to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Life is unpredictable, and finding that equilibrium between living in the moment and securing retirement is vital.

#### Avoid Unnecessary Investment Risks

In pursuing higher returns, it's easy to fall prey to investment trends that promise quick riches. Close-to-retirement individuals exercise caution and avoid succumbing to unrealistic promises. Stick to a well-diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Remember, preserving your wealth is just as crucial as growing it. Why would you take unnecessary risk if you can retire within your timeframe and achieve your goals?

#### Conclusion

Making prudent money moves as you approach retirement is very important. Prioritizing retirement savings, starting early, avoiding premature fund withdrawals, estate planning, seeking professional advice, balancing present enjoyment, and prudent investing are all integral to securing your financial future. By following these essential steps, you'll position yourself for a comfortable retirement, allowing you to enjoy your golden years with peace of mind and financial stability. Remember, every dollar saved and invested today is an investment in the quality of your retirement tomorrow, and your trusted Spokane financial advisor is there to help you every step of the way.
