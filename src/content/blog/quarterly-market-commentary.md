#### Overview

After a year of abysmal investment returns globally in both stocks and bonds in 2022, the first quarter of 2023 saw investment returns begin to climb out of the trough, a continuation of a return to positive returns that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Other than commodities, US and global stocks and bonds returns ended up in the black for the first quarter, but not without volatility.  Global central banks, including the Fed, continued with their synchronized policies of raising short-term interest rates to temper demand, and consequently, inflation, which is proving itself difficult to tame. Uncertainty about how long these interest rate hikes will continue and to what level rates will need to rise, along with rising recession concerns and the resulting impact on corporate earnings, have equity investors nervous, which will only lead to ongoing volatility and lack of direction in equity markets shortly. 

#### Banking Issues

The failure of SVB and Signature Bank in the US, and that of Credit Suisse in Switzerland, are evidence of the strains that the central bank’s interest rate policies are putting on the global financial system.  This, along with recession concerns, is leading bond investors to foresee lower interest rates shortly, which is reflected in a broad and significant drop in rates across the US Treasury yield curve during the later part of March.  Representative domestic and global index returns (total returns including the reinvestment of interest and dividends) for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 calendar year are shown in the following table (*these represent index returns (2) for several asset classes and not for your portfolio, and are for informational purposes only):*  

Interest Rates & Inflation

![statistics showing index returns](/assets/images/blog/statistics-showing-index-returns.webp "statistics showing index returns")

Due to the lack of any significant changes in the market outlook so far this quarter, this commentary will be a bit briefer than normal. The Fed continues its focus on knocking inflation back down to a target level of 2.0%, and as Chairman Jerome Powell has stated on multiple occasions, the Fed will do whatever it takes to succeed in this endeavor, even if it leads to a recession and higher unemployment (which is not making some politicians very happy to hear). The Fed continues to raise short-term interest rates and reduce the money supply (something that is not broadly discussed but is very important).  Since March of 2022, the Fed has raised the Fed Funds rates from essentially 0% to the current range of  4.75% - 5.00%. 

This is a huge move! The inflation rate is trending lower (from a high of around 9.5% YOY in June of 2022 to a level of around 6.0% YOY in February of 2023 as measured by the CPI) but is proving to be more resilient than expected.  The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) came in at 5.0% YOY, still a 3.0% spread from the Fed’s target of 2.0%. As the Fed appears resolute in its task, this puts more pressure on the Fed to continue to raise rates to higher levels which in turn will put more strain on the economy. As the US economy shows signs of slowing, employment remains strong, with the unemployment rate hovering around 3.5%, again pressuring the Fed for potentially higher rates and perhaps a longer period.  

#### Other Signs

![Lots of road signs](/assets/images/blog/lots-of-road-signs.webp "Lots of road signs")

The recent high-profile failure of two US banks (SVB and Signature Bank), and the unified bailout of a fourth (First Republic Bank), along with the failure of Credit Suisse and its orchestrated acquisition by UBS, are collectively showing the pressures that higher interest rates are having upon the financial system. 

“Cracks” are developing. However, as Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan pointed out in his latest letter to shareholders, the recent bank failures are not pervasive throughout the banking system but those that are occurring and maybe will occur are a consequence of poor management decisions at the failed institutions and a lack of regulatory oversight to some degree (political influence, perhaps).   

#### Recession

We are coming out of an extended period of policy-induced monetary and fiscal excesses, some COVID-related and some in response to the Great Recession in 2008-2009. It is these excesses that triggered inflation, overleveraging, speculation, and overvaluation in many asset classes, and it will take some time for these excesses to be worked out of the global financial system unless policies allow them to continue which would be unfortunate.  In the meantime, we are most likely headed into a [recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) which will directly impact the economy and corporate earnings, and therefore stock valuations to some degree. 

#### The Good

However, higher interest rates provide higher returns from bonds, returns that are more representative of historical bond returns and which can be accretive to portfolio returns and portfolio stability moving forward.  In expectation of more volatility this year, we continue to hedge a portion of our stock exposure against stock market declines, favor quality holdings in our portfolios, and extend the bond duration to lock in yield where possible.
