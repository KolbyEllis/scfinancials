Are you interested in making your money work for you? 

If you're in Spokane and seeking advice on how to start investing wisely, you've come to the right place. Investing is an excellent way to build wealth over time, and it's not just reserved for the wealthy. With some knowledge and a solid plan, anyone can begin their investment journey. In this beginner's guide, we'll walk you through 10 steps to confidently start investing.



#### Step 1: Understand Your Financial Situation

Before jumping into the investing world, it's crucial to assess your financial situation. Look closely at your income, expenses, and overall financial goals. Ensure you have the following:

**An Emergency Fund:** Before investing, it's vital to have an emergency fund of at least three to six months' worth of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account. This serves as a safety net for unexpected financial emergencies.

**No High-Interest Debt:** Pay off high-interest debts like credit card balances before investing. It's challenging to earn higher returns in the stock market while paying high interest on debts.



#### Step 2: Educate Yourself

Knowledge is power when it comes to investing. Spend time learning about different investment options, risk factors, and the basics of financial markets. You can do this through various means:

* **Meet with a Financial Advisor:** Even if you have little money, many financial advisors are willing to provide valuable advice. Near you in Spokane, Stewardship Concepts can help educate and guide you in the right direction based on your situation.
* **Read Books:** Explore books on investing and personal finance. Renowned authors like Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, and John      Bogle have written informative books on the subject.
* **Utilize Online Resources:** Reputable websites, podcasts, and YouTube channels dedicated to finance and investing offer valuable insights and news on current market trends. However, be cautious about the source of your advice. Seek professional advice from a Certified Financial Plannerâ„¢.



#### Step 3: Define Your Investment Goals

Your investment goals will be the compass guiding your decision-making process. They will also determine your time horizon and risk tolerance. Whether you're saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or your child's education, having a clear objective will help you choose the right investment strategy. If your goals are further out, you can take more risk, but if you're trying to accumulate money for a home down payment next year, it's better to keep that money in a safer investment.



#### Step 4: Determine Your Risk Tolerance

Understanding your risk tolerance is a crucial factor in shaping your investment strategy. Assess how comfortable you are with the possibility of losing money. Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks because they have a longer time horizon to recover from market downturns, while older investors may prefer more conservative investments.

#### Step 5: Determine Your Risk Capacity

Another critical factor to consider is your risk capacity. This is the risk your financial plan can absorb before forcing you to change your goals. For instance, you may have the emotional space to absorb more risk, but because you're close to retirement, it's wiser to lower risk to ensure a successful retirement plan.



#### Step 6: Choose Your Investment Accounts

The type of investment accounts you select should align with your financial goals. Common account types include:



* **Individual Brokerage Accounts:** Suitable for general investing purposes but offer no tax advantages.
* **Retirement Accounts (e.g., 401(k), IRA):** Designed for long-term retirement savings, offering tax advantages.
* **Education Savings Accounts (e.g., 529 plans):** For saving for educational expenses, often with tax benefits.
* **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):** Used to save for medical expenses, offering tax advantages.



Make sure you understand the tax implications of each account type. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) a Spokane Financial Advisor for guidance.



#### Step 7: Diversify Your Investments

Diversification is a crucial strategy to reduce risk. Avoid putting all your money into a single investment or asset class. Spread your investments across various assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments like structured products or commodities.



#### Step 8: Start with Simple Investments

If you're new to investing, it's best to begin with straightforward options like index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. These investment vehicles provide instant diversification and are less risky than individual stocks. As you gain confidence and expertise, you can explore other investment options.



#### Step 9: Automate Your Investments

Consider setting up automatic contributions to your investment accounts. Automating your investments ensures consistency and helps you take advantage of dollar-cost averaging, which can reduce the impact of market volatility. As a rule of thumb, aim to save or invest at least 15% of your income, but remember that this may vary depending on your unique situation.



#### Step 10: Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio

Your investment strategy should evolve as your goals and risk tolerance change. Regularly review your portfolio, rebalance it, and stay on track with your financial objectives. It's crucial to update your financial plan as life is full of uncertainties, and the assumptions you made initially may change.



Embarking on an investment journey in Spokane can be a rewarding and empowering experience. By understanding your financial situation, educating yourself, setting clear goals, and following a thoughtful investment plan, you can set yourself on a more secure financial future. Remember, investing is a long-term commitment, and success requires patience and discipline. Start today and watch your money grow over time.
