#### How we created this list of Top Financial Advisors in Spokane

When managing your finances, finding expert and honest guidance is vital.

Our goal at Stewardship Concepts is to help people. We would love to help all of Spokane with their financial planning process. But we know we aren't always the right fit based on your needs.

We've created this list based on our firm serving on the board of the Spokane Financial Planning Association, Certified Financial Planner™ designation, and years of working alongside them in the industry.



#### Best Spokane Financial Advisors in 2024

How We Connected with the Top Financial Planners in Spokane

"As a top-producing real estate agent, your wealth is closely tied to the success of the real estate market. This can lead to significant personal income, but it can also leave you vulnerable to the market's highs and lows. You may lack the time to effectively manage your commission-based income and create a net worth that lessens your reliance on real estate. That's where we come in. We provide exclusive financial planning for real estate agents."



Jon Davis, Christiansen, Quantum Financial Planning, – Spokane, WA

"We design, integrate, and implement financial plans for professionals, district employees, teachers, and families that are designed to help minimize taxation, preserve resources, and maximize performance. Our financial planning process will help you clarify your financial goals, educate you on your options and strategies, analyze your current position, design a customized blueprint of your future, implement effective strategies, and review to adjust to life changes."



Kurt Heineman, Vision Casting Financial Planning, LLC – Spokane, WA

"I developed a process to help you be purposeful about your finances and making sure they are aligned with your values. As your financial planner, it's critical to me that I understand what your best interests are so that I can serve you well. I'm highly skilled at helping individuals and couples verbalize their goals."



#### How Stewardship Concepts Financial Services is Different from Other Spokane Financial Advisors

When you're searching for your financial advisor, it can sometimes be challenging to spot the differences.

At Stewardship Concepts, we believe three areas that separate us from other firms:

1. Our expertise stretches far beyond wealth management. Over our career, we've developed a unique process that analyzes much more of your financial picture, such as estate planning and risk.
2. We work as a team—our firm values your other professionals. We work with your accountant and attorney when needed to reduce taxes now and in retirement.
3. We specialize in the details of transitioning to retirement. By focusing on clients who are pre-retirees and business owners, we've developed a deep understanding of your specific situation.

If Stewardship Concepts could be a potential fit for you, schedule a discovery meeting with one of our advisors.



#### All of the Spokane Best Financial Advisors Have This In Common

There is a vast range of services, experience, and expertise available when you are searching for the right financial advisor. Our list of the five best financial advisors in Spokane all have three things in common:

* They are fee-only. We will be the first to admit there is no perfect fee structure. However, finding an advisor who is fee-only limits the conflicts of interest for the advisor
* They are ALWAYS a Fiduciary. This means the advisor must always put their client's interests ahead of their own.
* They are a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™. If the financial advisor is a CFP®, you know they have met the rigorous requirements of education, exam, experience, and ethics regulated by the CFP® board.

Keep in mind that this list doesn't encompass all of your options, so ensure that you research and select the financial advisor that best fits your needs.
